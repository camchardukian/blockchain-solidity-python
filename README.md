# Solidity, Blockchain, and Smart Contracts

This repo contains code I wrote and notes I took while going through Patrick Collin's [Solidity, Blockchain, and Smart Contract Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M576WGiDBdQ).

I spent a few dozen hours going through this course in order to get exposure to a number of concepts and technologies such as smart contracts, DeFi, NFTs/ERC721s, ERC20s, Ethereum, Solidity, etc.
