# Section 11 — NFTs

## Intro

NFT stands for Non Fungible Token.

NFTs can also be referred to as ERC-721s.

Some popular NFT marketplaces are OpenSea and Rarible.

## ERC-721

It’s significantly cheaper to store our data off-chain. For that reason, it’s common to use an image URI, rather than storing a 1MB or otherwise large image on-chain.

NFTs can be an excellent example of hybrid smart contracts. They have some off-chain elements as well as some on-chain elements.

We can read about the ERC-721 standard [here](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721).

## KYC

One way to measure the decentralization of a platform is to see whether is has some form of [KYC](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-kyc-and-why-does-it-matter-for-crypto/#:~:text=KYC%20means%20%22know%20your%20customer,use%20to%20fight%20money%20laundering.) (Know Your Customer)

Some decentralized tools without KYC are:

- Skynet
- Arweave
- Filecoin
- IPFS
- Ethereum

## IPFS

We should never host our metadata on a centralized server.

Decentralized storage is constantly becoming more and more sophisticated and reliable.

IPFS has a command line and downloadable GUI we can use to help us run different commands to interact with IPFS.

## Pinata

Pinata is an IPFS file management service.
